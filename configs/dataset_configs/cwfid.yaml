# CWFID dataset configuration
# Reference: Haug & Ostermann (2015)
# "A Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset for the Evaluation of Computer Vision
#  Based Precision Agriculture Tasks"
#
# Task: Instance segmentation / object detection (crop vs weed)
# Size: 60 annotated field images (RGB + NIR), 1296×966 px
# Classes: 2 (crop = carrot, weed = various broadleaved species)
# Note: Small dataset — use data augmentation and pre-trained weights.

task: segment   # can also be used as detect with bounding-box annotations
